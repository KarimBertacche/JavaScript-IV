// CODE here for your Lambda Classes
// First we need a Person class. This will be our base-class
// Person receives name age location gender all as props
// Person receives speak as a method.
// This method logs out a phrase Hello my name is Fred, I am from Bedrock where name and location are the object's own props

class Person {
    constructor(attributes) {
        this.name = attributes.name;
        this.age = attributes.age;
        this.location = attributes.location;
        this.gender = attributes.gender;
    }

    speak() {
        return `Hello my name is ${this.name}, I am from ${this.location}`
    }
}

// Now that we have a Person as our base class, we'll build our Instructor class.
// Instructor uses the same attributes that have been set up by Person
// Instructor has the following unique props:
// specialty what the Instructor is good at i.e. 'redux'
// favLanguage i.e. 'JavaScript, Python, Elm etc.'
// catchPhrase i.e. Don't forget the homies
// Instructor has the following methods:
// demo receives a subject string as an argument and logs out the phrase 'Today we are learning about {subject}' where subject is the param passed in.
// grade receives a student object and a subject string as arguments and logs out '{student.name} receives a perfect score on {subject}'

class Instructor extends Person {
    constructor(attributes) {
        super(attributes);
        this.specialty = attributes.specialty;
        this.favLanguage = attributes.favLanguage;
        this.catchPhrase = attributes.catchPhrase;
    }

    demo(subject) {
        return `Today we are learning about ${subject}`
    }

    grade(studentObj, subject) {
        return `{studentObj.name} receives a perfect score on {subject}`
    }
}

// Now we need some students!
// Student uses the same attributes that have been set up by Person
// Student has the following unique props:
// previousBackground i.e. what the Student used to do before Lambda School
// className i.e. CS132
// favSubjects. i.e. an array of the student's favorite subjects ['Html', 'CSS', 'JavaScript']
// Student has the following methods:
// listsSubjects a method that logs out all of the student's favoriteSubjects one by one.
// PRAssignment a method that receives a subject as an argument and logs out that the student.name has submitted a PR for {subject}
// sprintChallenge similar to PRAssignment but logs out student.name has begun sprint challenge on {subject}

class Student extends Person {
    constructor(attributes) {
        super(attributes);
        this.previousBackground = attributes.previousBackground;
        this.className = attributes.className;
        this.favSubject = attributes.favSubject;
    }

    listsSubjects() {
        return this.favSubject.forEach(el => console.log(el));
    }

    PRAssignment(subject) {
        return `${this.name} has submitted a PR for ${subject}`
    }

    sprintChallenge(subject) {
        return `${this.name} has begun sprint challenge on ${subject}`
    }
}
